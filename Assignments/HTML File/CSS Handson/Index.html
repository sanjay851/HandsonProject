    <h2><i><b>What is CSS ?</b></i></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other meadia.</li><br>
        <li><del><b>Css is not neccesary</b></del><span><b>CSS saves a lot of work.</b></span>It can controal the layout of 
            multiple webpages all at once</li><br>
        <li><ins><i>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</i></ins></li>
    </ol>
    <h2><i><b>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</b></i></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external css file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS , is to keep the styles in external CSS files.
             however <span><b>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</b></span>,
             because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself .</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID  class , the difference in that CSS class applies a style 
        to multiple elements ID,on the other hand ,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also 
        special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.   
    </p>
    <p>
        In CSS , selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage.once an element 
        has been targeted , a style or set of styles can be appled to the element.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a wide range of selectors available .Two of the most commoly 
        used are class and ID .Both are used yo target elements to which a style should be applied .
